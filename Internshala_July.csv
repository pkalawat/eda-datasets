                    About Unihire                

        Unihire is a platform that connects companies with universities and colleges to hire students for full-time roles/internships

We help companies, college management, and students streamline the whole end-to-end hiring process on a single online platform. Some of the core benefits of the platform are; that students get access to better opportunities based on their individual capabilities. They don't have to depend on the limited outreach of their college to get a good start in their career.

Secondly, universities can focus on what they do best - provide world-class education. Companies directly reach out to the relevant campuses and we manage the whole application process end-to-end. No need for email attachments and excel sheets. Also, companies save a lot of time by directly broadcasting a job to the relevant colleges rather than repeating the same process for each new college. Getting applications back take days rather than weeks because of our deep integration.

        Finlock is a Delhi-based cybersecurity startup that is on a mission to protect people from online fraud. The startup is seed-funded and incubated at IIM Calcutta Innovation Park. We develop AI-based intelligent solutions for online fraud detection. We have products in both the B2C and B2B markets. It was started in 2021 by two college friends (IITian and MBA from Georgetown University) after 14 years of corporate experience. Both founders were themselves victims of online fraud and this inspired them to develop solutions to prevent others from going through similar trauma.

Website 


        We are a bunch of crazy travelers and believe traveling is not just visiting a place and taking selfies and social media updates. It's a connection and an experience of a place in terms of culture, arts, history, people, etc.

We believe that people are always above technology, so, we are coming up with a platform that connects local people to travelers. ""Are we a marketplace?"" Nope, we are not a marketplace. Our locals whom we call our Amigos are screened through a rigorous process and their profiles are scrutinized minutely keeping in consideration various security aspects. Our system automatically matches the right Amigo with our prospective clients based on their interests and likings. We serve travelers, not tourists. So why are you still waiting? Pack your bags, charge yourselves and be ready to have a memorable experience with Leamigo.

                    About Gemopai Electric-Scooters                

Website 


        With the aim to make every Indian #FeelTheFuture, Goreen E-Mobility Private Limited, and Opai Electric decided to come together in 2018, wanting to create a shift in the transportation industry, resulting in Gemopai. An Indian brand of electric two-wheelers that envisioned to revolutionize the way how India and the world commute with a cheaper and sustainable option of energy available to them. 

The road was not easy, as we did not have to make people switch from one option to another, but we had to change their perception. With the opening of our first manufacturing unit, capable of producing 1000 units per day, Gemopai became one of the trusted EV brands, and within just 2 years expanded its reach from all across India to other parts of the world.

                    About Citrus Solutions Private Limited                

Website 


        Citrus was established in the year 2004 with the sole objective of developing an eco-friendly, zero-maintenance, and green computing experience which was not only space-saving but also energy-saving for a large IT setup. Keeping this in mind, we were one of the pioneers to introduce Thin Client to the Indian market. We established ourselves early, gaining a first-mover advantage, thanks to the unwavering support of Intel and Microsoft. 

We were able to design a product that was always ahead of the competition by sourcing all components from OEMs (the best in the industry). Gradually, we moved into Mini-PCs/ SFF PC/ Rugged PC/ Industrial PC over the years to facilitate the hardware needs of the evergrowing IT industry.

Website 


        Parsi Dairy Farm  Private Limited a family business was established in the year 1916. It was started by a young Parsi entrepreneur late Nariman Ardeshir.

In the year 1967, the family purchased farmland near Talasari, in the village of Varvada, along the Mumbai -Gujarat highway, where we serve delicious vegetarian food along with our regular mithais and other products. What started as a simple milk business, was prospering by staying true to its tagline, ""Rich! Pure! Wholesome!"". Parsi Dairy Farm was one of the first businesses in India to introduce yogurt. There was also further growth in the product portfolio of the Indian sweets (Mithai) business. Our Flagship Store is located at 261/63, Shamaldas Gandhi Marg, Princess Street, Marine Lines (East), Mumbai -400002.

Website 


        On the horizon, there always lies a new breakthrough, a discovery, and more efficient ways to build a better world. At the center of this age, revolutions are individuals who play the parts of being an innovator, team player, problem-solver, and design thinker simultaneously! Developing students to become such visionaries is possible if they are taught to innovate and apply new solutions to everyday problems, from a young age.

The conventional methods of merely testing memory power aren't enough. The future demands new ideas that can be executed to change our lives for the better. Enabling students with creative, analytical, scientific and design thinking methods is crucial to prepare them for any challenges that are yet to come.

Bibox Labs understands this vision and undertakes this initiative in schools to teach, develop, and mentor students to innovate ahead of their time.

Our system automatically matches the right Amigo with our prospective clients based on their interests and likings. We serve travelers, not tourists. So why are you still waiting?

                    About Unihire                

        Unihire is a platform that connects companies with universities and colleges to hire students for full-time roles/internships

We help companies, college management, and students streamline the whole end-to-end hiring process on a single online platform. Some of the core benefits of the platform are; that students get access to better opportunities based on their individual capabilities. They don't have to depend on the limited outreach of their college to get a good start in their career.

Secondly, universities can focus on what they do best - provide world-class education. Companies directly reach out to the relevant campuses and we manage the whole application process end-to-end. No need for email attachments and excel sheets. Also, companies save a lot of time by directly broadcasting a job to the relevant colleges rather than repeating the same process for each new college. Getting applications back take days rather than weeks because of our deep integration.

About the job

4. Front-end Collaboration: Collaborating with front-end developers to ensure smooth integration between the server-side and client-side components. This may involve providing necessary APIs, discussing data formats, and working together to deliver end-to-end features and functionality.
5. Testing and Debugging: Writing unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase. Debugging and fixing issues in production or development environments, using debugging tools and techniques to diagnose and resolve problems.
6. Performance Optimization: Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in Node.js applications. This includes optimizing database queries, implementing caching mechanisms, using appropriate data structures, and adopting best practices to enhance the overall performance and scalability of the application.
7. Security and Authentication: Implementing security measures to protect the application and its data. This involves handling user authentication and authorization, validating input data, preventing common security vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting), and ensuring secure communication with external services.

Website 


        With the aim to make every Indian #FeelTheFuture, Goreen E-Mobility Private Limited, and Opai Electric decided to come together in 2018, wanting to create a shift in the transportation industry, resulting in Gemopai. An Indian brand of electric two-wheelers that envisioned to revolutionize the way how India and the world commute with a cheaper and sustainable option of energy available to them. 

The road was not easy, as we did not have to make people switch from one option to another, but we had to change their perception. With the opening of our first manufacturing unit, capable of producing 1000 units per day, Gemopai became one of the trusted EV brands, and within just 2 years expanded its reach from all across India to other parts of the world.

Website 


        Sneh Shilp Foundation is the culmination of years of hard work of Shilp. Shilp has been turning people's dreams into reality since 2004 by keeping their needs in focus and building around them. We wish to take a leap now and give back to society by doing what it takes to make a significant difference in people's lives. SnehShilp Foundation has been established with the sole purpose of empowering, strengthening and enabling people to live the life they truly deserve.

We sincerely believe that helping others is not a matter of time, it is about feelings followed by dedication. It isn't about doing great things; it is all about doing small things with great love. There is a lot of power in giving. Lending a hand to someone not only helps the one in need but greatly satisfies the thirst of the giver, the thirst for happiness and self-fulfillment.

                    About Unihire                

        Unihire is a platform that connects companies with universities and colleges to hire students for full-time roles/internships

We help companies, college management, and students streamline the whole end-to-end hiring process on a single online platform. Some of the core benefits of the platform are; that students get access to better opportunities based on their individual capabilities. They don't have to depend on the limited outreach of their college to get a good start in their career.

Secondly, universities can focus on what they do best - provide world-class education. Companies directly reach out to the relevant campuses and we manage the whole application process end-to-end. No need for email attachments and excel sheets. Also, companies save a lot of time by directly broadcasting a job to the relevant colleges rather than repeating the same process for each new college. Getting applications back take days rather than weeks because of our deep integration.

Website 


        Finlock is a Delhi-based cybersecurity startup that is on a mission to protect people from online fraud. The startup is seed-funded and incubated at IIM Calcutta Innovation Park. We develop AI-based intelligent solutions for online fraud detection. We have products in both the B2C and B2B markets. It was started in 2021 by two college friends (IITian and MBA from Georgetown University) after 14 years of corporate experience. Both founders were themselves victims of online fraud and this inspired them to develop solutions to prevent others from going through similar trauma.
